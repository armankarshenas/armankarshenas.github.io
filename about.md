## Arman Karshenas, Ph.D.

I am Dr. Arman Karshenas, a researcher, data scientist, and entrepreneur with a passion for leveraging machine learning to solve complex problems in biophysics, genomics, and life sciences. With a diverse academic background and practical experience, I have contributed to advancements in computational biology, data-driven insights for drug development, and applications of artificial intelligence in biological research.

### Industry Experience

I have had the opportunity to work in both academia and industry, bridging the gap between scientific research and real-world applications.

- **Data Scientist / ML Engineer Intern** | [Pivotal Bioventures](https://www.pivotalbioventures.com) (Jan 2024 – Aug 2024)  
  Applied machine learning and data science methods to drug development and clinical trials. My work focused on building predictive models to improve decision-making processes for biotech investments, analyzing large datasets to derive actionable insights, and optimizing the tools used for due diligence in mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
  

- **Fellow** | Pear VC — [Persian Founder Circle](https://pear.vc/communities/persian-founder-circles/) (Aug 2024 – Nov 2024)  
  Participated in a fellowship designed to support Persian founders with entrepreneurship insights.

### Research Experience

My research spans several areas of biophysics, machine learning, and computational biology, with an emphasis on applying AI models to biological datasets.

- **Graduate Student Researcher** | UC Berkeley (May 2022 – Dec 2024)  
  Researching genome regulation from the sequence space of enhancers in [Prof. Garcia’s lab](http://garcialab.berkeley.edu), combining computational and experimental methods.

- **PhD Rotation Projects** | UC Berkeley  
  - Developed assays for viral detection of influenza strains and genome re-assortment in [Fletcher’s lab](https://fletchlab.berkeley.edu).  
  - Created computational pipelines for protein folding studies in the [Marqusee lab](https://zebra.berkeley.edu).  
  - Studied transcription variability between sister chromatin in developing *D. melanogaster embryos* [Garcia lab](http://garcialab.berkeley.edu).

- **MPhil Project** | University of Cambridge (Oct 2020 – Jul 2021)  
  Developed a novel deep learning pipeline to extract morphological measurements from micro-CT scans and conducted
genome-wide association tests on *cichlid* fish samples in [Prof. Richard Durbin's group](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/research-groups/durbin).
