- name: "Quantitative Biology Bootcamp 2023"
  code: "QBC"
  semester: "Fall 2023"
  description: "This course aims to equip students with the tools to analyze and model biological phenomena using quantitative techniques. With the advent of new experimental methods, biology now generates vast amounts of data, and this course teaches how to apply physics, mathematics, and statistics to make sense of it. Students will explore topics such as cell biology, physiology, neuroscience, and evolution, using simple calculations and numerical simulations in Python to develop and test theoretical models. The course emphasizes the role of biological numeracy in advancing scientific discovery and prepares students to apply these skills in their own research."
