## Introduction

Welcome to my blog! In this first post, I want to introduce some of the exciting work I’ve been involved with lately. As part of my research at UC Berkeley, I’ve been exploring how machine learning models can be applied to genomic data to predict enhancer functions in fruit flies.

## The Role of Enhancers in Genomics

Enhancers are regulatory DNA sequences that control the transcription of nearby genes. Understanding how these enhancers function is a critical part of advancing our knowledge of gene expression and regulation. Recently, I’ve been working on developing computational models to predict enhancer activity based on sequence data.

## Machine Learning for Enhancer Prediction

We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model the relationship between DNA sequences and their enhancer functions. This approach allows us to analyze large genomic datasets more efficiently than traditional methods. The use of deep learning techniques opens up new possibilities in genomic research.

## Conclusion

I’m excited to share more about this research in future posts. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and insights into the intersection of genomics and AI!
