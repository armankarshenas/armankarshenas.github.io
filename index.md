# Welcome to my Personal Webpage!

I am a researcher, data scientist, and entrepreneur with expertise in applying machine learning to biological data, particularly in genomics, biophysics, and life sciences. I have a strong academic background, having completed an MPhil from the University of Cambridge and a BA from the University of Oxford. I am currently finishing my PhD at UC Berkeley, where I work on understanding enhancer functions in fruit flies and exploring how generative AI models can map enhancer sequences to spatial gene expression patterns.
